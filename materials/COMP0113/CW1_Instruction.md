# Coursework 1: Group Programming Project

Completion requirements

This coursework is worth 75% of the overall **module** mark. The project is given a single group mark unless the group requests differently.

**The hand in deadline is 26/3/2024, 4pm BUT you will also need to demonstrate to Anthony on Friday 28th March. Sessions to be organised.**

**Please use Unity 6 for development (specifically version 6000.0.34f1 from https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive). If you want to use something else, please chat with Anthony.

#### Overview

You are tasked with designing and developing a collaborative avatar creation system for use in social mixed reality (MR) or virtual reality (VR) environments. The system should allow multiple users to collaborate on creating, customizing, and interacting with avatars. For any avatar created it should be possible for the user to "inhabit" the avatar.

The primary focus of this coursework is to enable rich collaboration and support creative processes around avatar design in a shared virtual or mixed reality space. Below are guidelines and suggestions to help you approach this project.

Your system should accommodate multiple users simultaneously. For example, two or more users might collaborate on designing an avatar in real time, or one user could take on the role of a mentor guiding others through the creation process. Different configurations and roles are encouraged.

The task may include gamified elements to enhance engagement, but the objective is not to build a game. Instead, the emphasis is on facilitating meaningful collaboration and interaction among users.

We are particularly interested in seeing how you develop interactive objects and tools for avatar creation where multiple people can engage.



#### Groups

We want you to complete this coursework in **groups of 3 or 4**. You may divide responsibility however you wish. Each group receives a single mark unless the group discusses this with Anthony. See below for the marking scheme.

We will lend each group at least two Meta Quest headsets to program with. You are also welcome to work in our laboratories and use other equipment. Please discuss with the TAs in the first instance.



#### Background

You will use [Ubiq, our open source social virtual reality platform](http://ubiq.online/). Ubiq support the following basic functionalities:

- Allowing users to connect to each other and see each other as avatars
- Voice communication
- Virtual reality support OR mouse and keyboard interaction (for those who donâ€™t have access to a HMD and to support development)
- Examples of how to set up interaction between the user and objects, and shared interactive objects.
- Simple functionality to manage multiple different zones and users.
- Simple server-side functionality for you to monitor the system, check which users are connected and what rooms they are located in.
- Support for more novel mixed-reality devices, including augmented reality devices.



#### Inspiration

You are encouraged to draw inspiration from existing applications. In week 4 of the module, we will explore examples of social VR systems. Conducting independent research into avatar creation and collaborative design experiences is highly recommended. Hands-on exploration of various types of content can also spark ideas.

Possible features or tasks your system might support include:

- Collaborative sculpting and customization of avatars, including adjusting body shapes, facial features, and clothing (e.g. similar to some aspect of the Meta Avatars).
- Focussing on a parameterised system that allows users to abstract choose from a simple set of menus (e.g. similar to the system in Museum of Other Realities).
- Dynamic avatars that use particle effects, animated geometry, unusual shapes, where the user has some control over this by movement or voice, etc. (e.g. Half + Half, or get inspiration from this famous [DesignBoom video).](https://www.designboom.com/art/method-design-2016-aicp-sponsor-reel-06-14-2016/)
- Systems that focus on the clothing of avatars, choosing different styles or colours (e.g. see CocoVR or many others). 
- Avatars designed for mixed reality that adopt some colours or style from the real environment. For example, trying to camoflague or automatically fit a style.
- Avatars that respond to other sensors in the environment. 

For any idea, discuss your plans with the TAs as early as possible. We may have examples or resources to support your work. Reach out for guidance and feedback throughout the development process.

Some of the marks for the coursework can be achieved through creative ideas.



#### Deadlines

***The hand in deadline is 26/3/2024, 4pm.***

***You will need to demonstrate to Anthony on Friday 28th March. Sessions to be organised.***



From Wednesday 5th February you should check in **WEEKLY** with the TAs in the lab session. This is compulsory. We expect the following progress:

- Wednesday 12th February, in the lab session. Each group must present to the TAs a script or storyboard (in whatever format you wish, words, pictures or just a verbal presentation) about the content of their experience and how the users will interact within it. This will be in groups within the Lab Practical session.
- Wednesday 26th February. In the lab session, demonstrate that you've started assembling the world, have a repository set up and have some interactions working. 
- Wednesday 5th March. In the lab session, demonstrate progress towards fully working interactions working in VR.
- Wednesday 12th March. Each team does an interactive walkthrough of their demonstration with the TAs and explains how the final live demonstration will work. This will be in groups within the Lab Practical session or by appointment with a TA later in that week. 
- Wednesday 19th March. Each team is making good progress on final demonstration.
- Monday-Wednesday 24th-26th March. Each team MUST do a dry-run demo with the TAs to ensure that the demonstration on Friday 28th March goes well.



This coursework will include a LIVE DEMONSTRATION (in week 11), where you will demonstrate your social environment by inviting Anthony (and possibly other TAs depending on how many people your environment supports), to complete the task.



#### Hand-In

You will hand in two items by ***TBD, 4pm on Moodle***

1. Code: Submit this by registering a final version at the deadline with a TA. Either a link to a zip file or a specific version hash for a git repository (other code repositories acceptable). If your zip file is over 500MB you will have to put it on a git repository.
2. Report: One report per group should be handed in.



The report, a maximum of five pages should cover:

- A summary description of the project.
- Your approach to the problem in terms of what you needed to model, how the work was split up.
- Highlight any parts of the code or modeling that you are particularly proud of. In particular, highlight any interaction methods.
- Include some screen captures.



#### Marking

Your group will receive one mark. The criteria are the following:

- Effectiveness of interaction of individual users with the environment (15%)
- Consistency, comprehensibility and visual style of the environment (15%)
- Code quality and project organisation (15%)
- The ability of users to collaborate on your task (15%)
- Clarity and structure of report (5%)
- Technical detail of report including illustrations (5%)
- Comprehensiveness of report (5%)
- Novelty and polish of environment (25%). 



Novelty and polish of environments is awarded for projects that are exceptional on one of the following criteria:

- Inventive interpretation of the brief
- Environment that explore the underlying networking mechanisms 
- Complex interaction mechanisms
- Providing detailed in-environment instructions
- Using advanced assets or animation
- Using external services such as voice APIs, machine learning, etc.
