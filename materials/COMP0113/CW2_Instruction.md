## Coursework 2: Group Seminar Presentation

##### Overview

In this coursework, students in **pairs** will present research papers from recent conferences that cover Virtual Environments such as ACM CHI, wIEEE VR, ACM VRST and others. The purpose is for everyone to get a broad overview of what topics researchers are looking at, and what methods they use to demonstrate their new results. Your group should pick a paper from a list, do background research and present in one of the Monday sessions after reading week (see the week by week schedule).

This coursework is is worth 25% of the mark for this module. All members of each group will receive the same mark.

Each pair should pick ONE paper from the list of 46 papers below. [You MUST go to this page to indicate your choice, do not assume that you have that paper if you have not registered your choice](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=6120824). In the list below you can find a title and a DOI. A DOI is a unique descriptor of the paper. You can fetch any of the papers from that link if you are on the UCL network (e.g. via a VPN). If the VPN is not working for some reason you can email me to request the paper, but please only do this if other methods have failed. 

We will have three 15 minute slots in each lecture hour (thus three on Monday, six on Tuesday). You should make your presentation live in class. You should talk for no more than 10 minutes and leave 5 minutes for questions and hand-over.

For all seminars, **the key objective is to describe the main result of the paper compared to the state of the art**. Do spend a few minutes explaining any key prior work that the paper made reference to. Do describe any systems built and the novelty. Explain in brief any experiment run. Explain the key result. Do not present exhaustive detail of the results, but try to summarise the key findings. Use images and videos as you find them in the paper or online.



##### Marking Criteria

**Presentation (30%**)

 \- Presentation structure

 \- Appropriate detail

 \- Clear presentation 

 \- Time-keeping



**Main Materials (30%)**

 \- Good summary of key results

 \- Good use of visual materials

 

**Relation to Prior Work (30%)**

\- Present work critically with respect to prior work. Try to establish where the presented work fits within its area:

- What does it do/examine that goes beyond or extends prior work?
- How might it be used in practice?
- Think critically - if you think that the approach or the presentation of results is problematic, then say so!

 \- Citations and links to other papers and also other material in the module (e.g. lectures, reading, etc.)

 

**Responses to questions in the seminar (10%)**

 \- Demonstration of breadth understanding of topics

 \- Evidence of all group members contributing

 \- Highlighting open questions versus established results



#### Deadline

You will give this seminar in either the Monday 10-11am or Tuesday 3-5pm slots in the second half of term. We will try to finish these seminars in the first three weeks after Reading Week to give you time later in the term to work on other coursework.[1
